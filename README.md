# Separation of drums from music signals

### Requirements:

Separation of harmonic and percussive components from music spectrogram (time-frequency domain)
• Anisotropy: dependence on direction
• Temporal continuity of harmonic sounds
• Temporal localization of percussive sounds (continuity along frequency)

Iterative search for such spectrograms that maximize the anisotropy (continuity
• over time vs. over frequency)
• Together, the two spectrograms (harmonic / percussive) equal the original spectrogram: Hh,i + Ph,i = Wh,i
